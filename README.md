This app is online (though UNDER CONSTRUCTION). You can find it at http://green-bag.bitballoon.com/

The idea of the application is to be able to compose a container with plants, and order it.

The main functions of the composing part already work:
You can make a new plant container, put as many plant spots in it as you wish, choose which plant you want in each spot, and also change the content of a spot, or delete it.
Every change you make, directly gets saved in a db.
I used a react front-end and a rails-api back-end.
